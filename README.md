## Objective

Build a fitness and workout planner application using generative AI APIs such as **Whisper** and **GPT 3.5** APIs as well as **YouTube Data API**, integrated with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.iohttps://streamlit.io) for its user interface to illustrate application workflow illustration as well as [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/) for automation.

## Abstract
The task involves building a decoupled architecture for the fitness application:
- Provide users with personalized workout plans based on user needs and goals using GPT 3.5 API
- Fetch links to 5 workout search results from Youtube using YouTube's Data API and transcribe them using OpenAI's Whisper API for context based search results
- Use the transcription file to call GPT 3.5 API to provide fetch best possible match to fulfill user needs by parsing through context and content generated by transcripts
- Access the application through Streamlit which pulls a Docker image of the application
- Backend processes are handled through Airflow which again uses a Docker image of the Airflow instance

## Project Components

### APIs
**Whisper API:** API for [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) speech-to-text open-source model which provides two endpoints for transcriptions and translations and accepts variety of formats (m4a, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, wav, webm). 

For the purpose of this assignment, Whisper API has been implemented to transcribe audio from Youtube Search results to later use them in context based matches with user requests using GPT 3.5 API.

**GPT 3.5 API:** API for [ChatGPT 3.5](https://openai.com/research/whisper) model which takes sequence of messages coupled with metadata as tokens to generate text completion which can either be natural language or code.

For the purpose of this assignment, GPT 3.5 API has been implemented to ask user for workout plans as well as build a query engine complemented by the transcripts of YouTube search results generated by Whisper to fetch best match to address user needs.

**YouTube Data API:** API for [YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) has been implemented to add YouTube's search functionality into our application. The API enables the application to search for the best 5 YouTube video searches based on search terms provided by users.

### Streamlit
Python library [Streamlit](https://streamlit.iohttps://streamlit.io) has been implemented in this application for its user interface. Streamlit offers user friendly experience to assist users in :

>  Request for best workout plans based on user goals and needs 

>  List 5 YouTube videos related to fitness based on user requests

>  Generate transcripts from fetched YouTube results for best content and context based matches

>  Ask questions related to transcriptions using the query engine to optimize searches
