## Objective

This app is developed as a part of a hackathon. Leveraging OpenAI's various APIs and any other API, we were asked to build something new and useful. FitFinder is a refined fitness helper which provides you with relevant videos based on things/exercises you are looking for. 

How is the different from YouTube search? Well, when you search for a single type of exercise on YouTube, you probably just get several videos which only contain that 1 exercise. Need more exercies? Sorry, you will have to do a new YouTube search. In comes FitFinder which can provide you with vidoes which have multiple exercies INCLUDING the exercise you initially searched for. This way you get to see and follow numerous exercies in a single video which is better than you searching for videos of each exercies one after another. 

To build this application we use generative AI APIs such as **Whisper** and **GPT 3.5** APIs as well as **YouTube Data API**, integrated with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.iohttps://streamlit.io) for its user interface to illustrate application workflow.

## Technical Abstract
We narrow our **use-case for this to Physiotherapy.** Physiotherapy exercies are largely divided into 3 categories, namely, Strengthening, Motion & Balance exercies. 

The task involves building a decoupled architecture for the fitness application:
- Provide users with personalized workout plans based on user needs and goals using GPT 3.5 API
- Fetch links to 4 videos for each of these categories by search results from Youtube using YouTube's Data API
- Transcribe them using OpenAI's Whisper API for context based search results
- Store all transcribed details & video details in a JSON object on S3 bucket
- Ask users for more details like which body part/area are they looking to work on? And if they wish, what particular exercise they also wish to include?
- Use the details provided by the user to generate a relevant prompt 
- Send this prompt to GPT 3.5 API along with context of all 4 videos of the category
- Return the baest matched video (embedded on streamlit UI) which has most content relted to the body area user asked for & contains the exercise the user mentioned

## Project Components

### APIs
**Whisper API:** API for [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) speech-to-text open-source model which provides two endpoints for transcriptions and translations and accepts variety of formats (m4a, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, wav, webm). 

For the purpose of this assignment, Whisper API has been implemented to transcribe audio from Youtube Search results to later use them in context based matches with user requests using GPT 3.5 API.

**GPT 3.5 API:** API for [ChatGPT 3.5](https://openai.com/research/whisper) model which takes sequence of messages coupled with metadata as tokens to generate text completion which can either be natural language or code.

For the purpose of this assignment, GPT 3.5 API has been implemented to ask user for workout plans as well as build a query engine complemented by the transcripts of YouTube search results generated by Whisper to fetch best match to address user needs.

**YouTube Data API:** API for [YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) has been implemented to add YouTube's search functionality into our application. The API enables the application to search for the best 5 YouTube video searches based on search terms provided by users.

### Streamlit
Python library [Streamlit](https://streamlit.iohttps://streamlit.io) has been implemented in this application for its user interface. Streamlit offers user friendly experience to assist users in :

>  Request for best workout plans based on user goals and needs 

> Use these inputs to optimize searches

>  List videos related to physiotherapy based on user requests
